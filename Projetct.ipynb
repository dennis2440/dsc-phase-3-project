There are many water points already established in the country, but some are in need of repair while others have failed altogether.The Two datasets in this project contain details of wells that are in Tanzania.\n"

    "The goal is to ensure that water wells in Tanzania are functional, providing reliable access to clean water for communities. Ensuring well functionality involves understanding various factors influencing the wells' status, such as management practices, payment methods, and water quality. Effective management and maintenance strategies can be developed by identifying key determinants of well functionality, leading to improved water access for the population."

    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "The primary problem is the high rate of non-functional water wells in Tanzania, which undermines efforts to provide safe and reliable water access. This project aims to identify the critical factors affecting well functionality, predict the status of wells using these factors, and recommend strategies to improve well management and maintenance."
